   Version 51.1
   * add func log2 log2f lrint lrintf to math.h
   * add func strtok_r to string.h
   * mmap use now page size alligned memory that is need by programs(GCC) to work ok
   * correct handling for extern inline in C99 Mode see http://gcc.gnu.org/ml/gcc/2007-03/msg01096.html

2009-02-06 Bernd_afa

   * lseek return now correct value when whence is not support (ffmpeg need this)

   * show the correct stack usage when run cli program ixstack -s and in ixprefs show stack usage is on
     fill not the stack with cookie values if stack pointer is not in bound of sp_lower sp_upper
     there seem some programs out, that change stack and dont set stack bounds correct.
     
   * the requester wrong ixnet is now too show when program start from workbench by moving wbstartup
     message code on same place as MOS on ix_open

    * a couple math#?.(c|h) fixes, updated math-68881.h, etc...

2009-01-27 Bernd_afa

    * fix old Bug that when ixstack envvar is set the stack for the vfork process was always limit
      to ixstack size.Now if the caller process of vfork have more stack, then this stacksize is used

    * change of the c99 funcs to use static inline in math.h
    * the have_xxx defines are now disable by default(need only enable on GCC build)
    
    * if no int __stack variable is set in program a default stacksize from the envvar ixstack is use.
      if no envarc:ixstack env var is find, the minimum stacksize is set to 512000 bytes.
      If on shell or Icon more stack than the minimum is set, then this stack size is use.

      Sound large, but Unix/Linux programs need lot stack.the value of 512 kb is a praxis value,
      because i find no program currently that use more stack than 400 kb.but dont think 512 kb is far enough.
      The cygwin Unix API give Unix/Linux tasks 2 MB of stack and also windows programs get on default
      2,5 MB of stack.So if you have lots of ram and you want be on the safe side better set ixstack to 2000000
      If you are low on amiga mem, you can lower the stack value upto 16384 same value as ixemul 48 or 49.

      BUT BE SURE ALWAYS look how much stack a program need.there are not much programs out, that work with this
      low stacksize correct.So you need carefully set the values in shell-startup or Icons by yourself to
      usefull values
      
    * a env variable IXENVARC add, if set then ixemul read first the env varibles on dir 
      envarc.This "Hack" help easy to get ixemul working when envhandler or happyenv is sued.
	  Limits: when you create a new env variable only in env and not in envarc then this is not
	          notice.So rule is, use always global env variables. 


    * bump revision to 50.0 use V48 signal handling, and MOS V49 additional functions
	  because on V49 Ports for 68k vfork, OWB, CTRL+c, end on stackoverflow 
	  dont work with the new MOS signalhandling on 68k.
	  Use of seperate files with ending _68k and modified makefile so should not break MOS build
	
	* 
    * updatet include files to help more programs easy porting
    * added atan2 strtoll
    * assert use the in newer GCC obsolete eeprintf func not. 
    
    * faster file access thru 16 kb buffer, gcc compile 40-50% faster
    
    * compile too with crosscompilers, because the generatet files are now
      not need.The file ix_internals_backup.h contain this infos now.So you can change
      here.
      WARNING: if you use this source and change lots in ixemul.h or user.h struct ,
               better run the program library/68060/68881/Create_header that is build always new
               on amigaos and verify if all offsets are correct in the ix_internals_backup.h files.
    
    * add atoll func to stdlib.h
    
    * add many C99 functions to math.h to get more programs working without changes
		 
2008-08-15  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed a race condition in global environment (ENV:) scanning.
	* Bumped version to 49.26.

2007-03-19  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed a silly bug in the "Ram Disk:" to "RAM:" conversion.
	* Fixed __load_seg for root directory (/).

2007-02-19  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>

	  failures.
	* Disabled SetExcept() optimization until GDB issue is sorted out.

2006-08-20  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed getpagesize() to return the actual page size.
	* Adjusted MorphOS ix_flush*() cache routines to invalidate/flush
	  m68k (JIT) cache aswell as PPC. This way m68k ixemul apps won't
	  break at least. No big deal, as far as I can tell these functions
	  are pretty much unused.

2006-08-16  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed vfork() PPCSPLower & PPCSPUpper alignment.
	* Fixed execve() atexit-handler calling to make sure stdio
	  file descriptors can't be close()d.
	* Bumped version to 49.23.

2006-04-05  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed pw_class to be "default" instead of NULL. NULL value made
	  ssh barf (strlen(NULL)).
	* Fixed AS225/INet225 pw_change to be time(NULL), not -1.
	* Bumped version to 49.22.

2006-03-11  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Now clears possibly pending CTRL-E and CTRL-F signals.

2006-03-10  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Limited the SetExcept sigmask to ixemul allocated signals only.
	  User allocated signals no longer cause exceptions (device I/O,
	  or anything else using user signals directly/indirectly).

2006-02-15  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed all printf family functions not to parse the format string
	  as multibyte.
	* Bumped version to 49.21.

2006-02-09  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed getfsstat(), fstatfs() and statfs() to LockDosList()/
	  NextDosList()/UnLockDosList() the doslist properly instead of
	  Forbid() and direct list scanning.
	* Fixed getfsstat(), fstatfs() and statfs() to make sure the device
	  process hasn't disappeared before sending a dospacket.
	* Removed use of custom __Close function, use dos Close instead.

2005-10-29  Mark Olsen <bigfoot@private.dk>
	* Mapped /dev/zero to zero: in __open.c

2005-10-25  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed ix_to_ados with foo:./[///]bar and foo:/[///]bar. Some stuff
	  appears to depend on this. Note that foo:../bar etc still works
	  different to original routine. If something depends on that
	  particular feature of the original routine, we're screwed.
	* Added ftruncate() seek workaround for buggy filesystems (FFS2).
	* Bumped version to 49.20.

2005-06-26  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Rewrote ix_to_ados path conversion routine, it was way too hairy
	  and buggy (for example .// and ..// were interpreted wrong). Now
	  it's a simple state-engine with exception for ix and abs-ados
	  path concatenation (needed by ksh cd for example). Also, it no
	  longer tries to optimize away parent elements in the path, as
	  this could have led into problems with softlinks.

2005-06-14  Jacek Piszczek <jacadcaps@poczta.onet.pl>
	* Tweaked termios defaults to match those used on linux, enabled
	  ISIG, stdin has output flags set as well as stdout now

2005-05-25  Jacek Piszczek <jacadcaps@poczta.onet.pl>
	* Fixed \n filter when IXTTY_ONLCR is disabled (uses INDEX now).
	* Added IXTTY_SPECIAL for sshconsole

2005-04-20  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Disabled CTRL-F -> SIGWINCH translation code, it isn't used by
	  anything anyway. It also broke ahi.device from ixemul apps.
	  There's still the Ixemul semaphore to send signals from outside
	  of ixemul.
	* Fixed setnetent()/endnetent()/getnetent() to be reentrant.
	* Fixed AS255 68k vsyslog() to actually print to the log instead
	  of stdout.
	* Fixed vsyslog()/AS225 68k vsyslog() to be reentrant.
	* Fixed getpass() to be reentrant.
	* MorphOS: Removed EmulCall68k in favor of EmulCallDirect68k.
	* Updated inet_network() to 1993 edition.
	* Fixed getnetent() wrong n_net value and alias parsing.
	* Fixed fread LARGEREADS: It didn't handle writes or ungetc before
	  large read.
	* Rootdir (/) emulation lists assigns now, too. [Pavel Fedin]
	* Bumped version to 49.19.

	* Added a \n to ^D filter when IXTTY_ONLCR is disabled.
	* TIOCSET* functions applied to stdin update stdout, etc to
	  fix some compatibility issues.
	* Bumped version to 49.17.

2005-02-16  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
	* Fixed snprintf/vsnprintf(p,0,...) wrong return value. Both
	  functions would always return -1 instead of the number of
	  characters that would have been written (not counting \0).
	* Bumped version to 49.16.

2005-01-14  David Gerber <zapek@morphos.net>
	* Fixed scandir() to return proper file types.

	  ixemul process.
	* Bumped version to 49.15.

2004-10-04  Harry Sintonen <sintonen@iki.fi>
