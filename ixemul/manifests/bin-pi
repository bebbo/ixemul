Unix emulation environment, Amiga lib.
.description
The ixemul.library provides a Unix emulation environment for the
Amiga.  This makes porting of typical Unix applications very easy,
with almost no changes required to the Unix source code.

This archive contains several versions of the runtime dynamic library
"ixemul.library" that is needed by Amiga binaries that have been
compiled to use this environment, a pipe handler used when ixemul
programs communicate via pipes to non-ixemul programs, several
auxiliary programs (ixprefs, ixrun, ixtimezone, ixtrace), and timezone
database files.
