Unix emulation environment, devel files.
.description
The ixemul.library provides a Unix emulation environment for the Amiga.
This makes porting of typical Unix applications very easy, with almost
no changes required to the Unix source code.

This archive contains the C runtime startup modules, the link time
library that interfaces to ixemul.library (libc.a), and the manual
pages for the supported functions.
