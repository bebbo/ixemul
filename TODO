	* remove pOS support.

1999-09-03  David Zaroski  <zaroski@cronus.ninemoons.com>

	* The following are in prioritized order
	* Add seamless cross-compiling capabilities to the build process
	* Fix lseek() bug reported by Rask
	* Add? nanosleep()

It appears that some of the following have already been taken care of,
but was not removed from the list. :( Something else TODO. :-)



***	Add support for serial line I/O, allowing a port of GNU (Taylor's)
	UUCP.

***	Add job control support. Partial support for stopping/resuming processes
	is already in place but it needs to be generalized so that it can be
	user for job control.

***	The stat() function (and/or opendir() ) is slow. Is it possible to
	speed this up?

***	Improve the (currently only partially implemented) ix.h header.

***     Document how to implement a fork() emulation

***	Amiga<->Unix pathname handling scheme:

	The following scheme might be feasible:
	
	Either through a function call or through a global variable, a program
	tells ixemul that it can use Amiga pathnames. In that case ixemul will
	translate all filenames to Unix pathnames internally. E.g., the open()
	function will start with this code:
	
	  if (process_can_use_amiga_pathnames)
	    pathname = a2u(pathname);
	
	Similar code is needed for fopen(), etc.
	
	With ixprefs you can state whether you want to accept these hints from
	programs or not.
	
	This means that a program must be prepared to handle both kinds of
	pathnames. This is only a problem if your program tries to parse the
	pathname.
	
	I think a function 'int ix_can_use_amiga_pathnames(void)' that returns TRUE
	if the user (through ixprefs) also accepts amiga pathnames would be the
	best way to do this.
	
	Functions a2u() and u2a() for pathname conversion would also be exported
	from ixemul (they are already available internally).

***	#include <unistd.h>

	main()
	{
	  char foo[1000];
	  read(0,foo,999);
	}

	Run this program, press Ctrl-C and it looks as if nothing has
	happened. You will have to actually press enter to see the
	shell prompt.

***	Open the math libraries on a per-task basis.

***	The initial value of the frame pointer is not set to NULL (as
	it should be). This makes backtracking the stack a bit more
	complicated as the current frame pointer has to be checked for
	being inside the current maximum stack frame (and it's almost
	impossible to do that with stackextension enabled...).

***	Implement socketpair().

***	ixstack should be able to modify stack even if the file is write protected
	(just like gzip).

***	Add proper locale support.

***	Improve math handling (especially math.h, ask Kriton for more info)

***	At every ixemul open ixnet tries to open bsdsocket.library or
	socket.library. If these are not present, it will do a disk access
	in LIBS, which is a performance penalty. Can we find something more
	elegant?

***	Make it possible for a program to turn off the Unix path
	translation of ixemul, so that it can use standard Amiga names.
