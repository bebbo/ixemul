This file documents bugs which have no obvious solution at the moment.
If they did have an obvious solution, they would be in TODO instead.

***	The date of a softlink is always Jan 1, 1970 and this is unlikely
	to be fixed until a future version of AmigaOS includes a efficient
	function to obtain the date of the softlink. The only way to
        obtain the date would be by using Examine()/ExNext() on the
        directory that contains the softlink.

***	When calling ixemul's write() on nonblocking file descriptors the
	library will block when the write cannot be performed (e.g. on
	pipe:filename). Neither can the block be avoided by using select().
	The problem is that there is no way to check beforehand if the
	dos.library Write() will block.

***	The environment (ENV:) is only reread if an environment setting was
	added. Ixemul relies on notification of ENV: to know when to reread
	the environment. Unfortunately, deleting a file or changing a file
	doesn't cause a notification, only creating a file. This is a bug
	in the OS.

***	If you stat() a directory, then the st_size field is always 1024.
	It should be the size of what you can read if you open() the
	directory, but that would mean that ixemul will have to
	Examine()/ExNext() the whole directory which is unacceptably slow.
	So any program that uses the st_size field to preallocate enough
	room for for either open() on a directory or opendir()/readdir()
	pairs will have to be rewritten not to use st_size.

***	Due to a bug probably in the emulation socket.library, the
	dos.library isn't closed by this socket.library if an OpenLibrary
	fails because the requested version is unavailable, but an older
	version exists.  Ixemul tries to open socket.library version 3, but
	the emulation library has version 1.2.  So each time you run an
        ixemul program, the dos.library open count is increased by one, and
        so is the count of socket.library.  The solution is to select
	'No networking' or 'AmiTCP' using ixprefs.

***	Opening a file a second time fails on an AFS volume if both times
	the file was opened with mode READWRITE. This happens during
	linking of a program if the TMPDIR setting points to an AFS volume.
	This is a bug in AFS. I've notified the author of AFS about this,
        so perhaps this is solved in a future AFS version.

	The following test program illustrates the problem:

		#include <proto/dos.h>

		main(int argc, char **argv)
		{
		  if (argv[1])  
		  {
		    BPTR f1, f2;

		    f1 = Open(argv[1], MODE_READWRITE);
		    f2 = Open(argv[1], MODE_READWRITE);
		    printf("%d, %d\n", f1, f2);
		    if (f1) Close(f1);
		    if (f2) Close(f2);
		  }
		}

        Both Open calls succeed on a FFS volume, but on an AFS volume the
        second fails.

***     If you have installed MultiUser on one volume, but not on another,
        then ixemul will still use the MultiUser protection bits and owner
        for the FFS volumes. This can cause problems when trying to access
        files that have the wrong owner and/or protection bits.
