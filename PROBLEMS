Subject: old enforcer hit problem fixed!

Some time ago I reported that I was getting enforcer hits on ramlib whenever
starting an ixemul client. Fred was not able to reproduce this problem using
a software configuration similar to mine.

It turns out that this is a known problem for the Fusion-Forty accelerator.
The fix is to upgrade the Fusion-Forty's MoveMH utility to version 1.2. I just
upgraded, and the problem has disappeared.

Subject: ixemul 43.0 Makefile.in and trouble-shooting entry

Hardware: A3000/25 Rev. 9.03, 37.175 ROM, 2+12MB, rev. 04 SCSI chip
	  Quantum LPS240S (id 0), IBM DPES 31080 SCSI-II (id 1)
Problem:  After installing the new IBM drive, ixemul clients cause serious
	  trouble and don't work properly. Symptoms: gcc chokes on
	  clean, compilable input files with unbalanced endif and similar
	  errors. Diff "finds" differences between identical files. Tar barfs
	  on intact archives.
Possible explanation: ixemul.library uses Disable()/Enable() excessively.
	  This may lead to a situation where the SCSI driver is slowed down
	  and the drive has to reselect more often. Reselect is the main
	  trouble source of the WDC33C93-04 chip.

Solution: Disable reselect for the drive (eg. with RDBFlags from Aminet).
Better solution: upgrade to AmigaOS 3.1 ;-)

============================================================================

If you use an ixemul.library compiled for the 68000 CPU on an Amiga with an
68040 CPU and working FPU, then the IEEESPMul call from mathieeesingbas.library
can cause an EMT trap.  This function is called indirectly if you multiply
two floats.  The solution is provided below.  Of course, it is even better
to just use the ixemul.library for an 68040 with FPU.

This triggered a faint memory of something I saw on aminet:

   MathPatch.lha      util/boot    3K  63+Patch for 68040 bug in "mathieeesingbas.

I installed that and it cured the problem.

If you get an "Abort" requester every time you start a Geek Gadgets
program, then check for the presence of the multiuser.library on your
system and remove it. Apparently this library can cause serious problems
with ixemul if there are no volume around that actually use MuFS.
