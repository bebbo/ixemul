/*
  timegm() is a GNU function that might not be available everywhere.
  It's basically the inverse of gmtime() - you give it a struct tm,
  and get back a time_t.  It differs from mktime() in that it handles
  the case where the struct tm is UTC and the local environment isn't.

  Some BSDs don't handle the putenv("foo") case properly, so we use
  unsetenv if the platform has it to remove environment variables.
