 * This is probably not the best we can do, but it is still 2-10 times
 * faster than the C version in the portable gen directory.
 *
 * Things that might help:
 *	- unroll the longword copy loop (might not be good for a 68020)
 *	- longword align when possible (only on the 68020)
 *	- use nested DBcc instructions or use one and limit size to 64K
