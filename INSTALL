		    IXEMUL  LIBRARY  INSTALLATION  NOTES

			   (last updated 27-May-97)


=====================
DISTRIBUTION CONTENTS
=====================

The net ixemul library distribution consists of several archives:

  ixemul-bin.lha	Utils for gg/bin, like ixtrace and ixprefs

  ixemul-sdk.lha	Files needed to build applications that use
			ixemul.library.

  ixemul-doc.lha	Various documentation, such as this file

  ixemul-src.tgz	Complete source code for ixemul library as
			a gzip compressed tar archive.

  ixemul-tz.lha		Pieces for doing TZ (timezone) management

  ixemul-CCCF.lha	Specific flavors of the library, where 'CCC'
			is one of 000, 020, or 040, for 68000, 68020,
			and 68040 respectively, and 'F' is either
			'f', 's', or 't' for FPU support or soft floating
			point or a "trace" version (also soft float)
			respectively.

The ixemul-doc.lha archive contains various readme and copyright files that
do not need to be installed anywhere.  The ixemul-src.tgz archive contains
the source tree that can be installed anywhere.  The rest of the archives
should simply be extracted relative to the gg: directory to put all the
files in their standard location.

========================
INSTALLING RUNTIME FILES
========================

For the moment, you must manually install the files.  Eventually there will
be an installer script available that you can use with the standard AmigaOS
installer program to make installation more WorkBench friendly.

First backup any files in gg: that will get overwritten during the install,
if you wish to preserve them.  These files typically are:

	gg:bin/ixprefs
	gg:bin/ixtrace
	gg:bin/ixstack
	gg:lib/bcrt0.o
	gg:lib/crt0.o
	gg:lib/rcrt0.o
	gg:lib/libc.a
	gg:lib/libb/libc.a
	gg:include		(lots of files, but probably not all)
	gg:man			(lots of files, but probably not all)
	gg:etc			(lots of files, but probably not all)
	gg:Sys/libs/ixemul*	(all the old versions of the library)

Change directory to gg: and extract the contents of ixemul-bin.lha,
ixemul-sdk.lha (if you expect to be building any ixemul.library using
applications), ixemul-tz.lha (optional) and any ixemul-XXXX.lha archives
that you want, overwriting any existing copies of the files in your Geek
Gadgets tree.  For example, to install the utils, sdk, and both the 68000
68040+68881 versions of the library, do the following:

	lha -mraxe x ixemul-bin.lha gg:
	lha -mraxe x ixemul-sdk.lha gg:
	lha -mraxe x ixemul-000.lha gg:
	lha -mraxe x ixemul-040f.lha gg:

Now you need to decide which version of the library to use, based on what
sort of machine you have (68000, 68020 or 68030, 68040) and whether or not it
has an FPU (68020+68881, 68030 with FPU, or 68040 with FPU).  Do something
like the following:

	cd gg:Sys/libs
	copy ixemul040fpu.library ixemul.library clone

Then either reboot or run a program to flush the existing ixemul.library (if
any) from memory.  You should also review the NEWS file from the docs
archive for changes made since the version from which you have upgraded.
If you installed the ixemul-tz.lha archive you should read ixtimezone.doc
from the docs archive and set your TZ environment variable appropriately.

=======================
INSTALLING SOURCE FILES
=======================

To extract the source code, simply cd to a directory where you would like
the source code directory to be created, and extract the source archive
there:

	cd gg-src:
	gzip -d ixemul-src.tgz
	tar -xvf ixemul-src.tar
	rm ixemul-src.tar

Note that this will create the directory ixemul and populate it with all the
source files.

To rebuild the library, all that is needed is to run the configure script
and then run make.  It is recommended that you use separate source and build
directories so you can leave the source tree untouched:

	cd gg-build:
	makedir ixemul
	cd ixemul
	sh /gg-src/ixemul/configure --prefix=/gg

This will create a Makefile and several subdirectories with other Makefiles.
Note the section in the Makefile that looks like:

###  CPU-FPU types.
###
###  The default thing to do is to make all reasonable combinations of the
###  library.
###
###  Note that libsrc, which builds the runtime startup files and all
###  versions of libc.a, and utils completely ignore the base/cpu/fpu variables,
###  so these are handled in the all: target.
###
###  You can remove specific CPU/FPU combinations that you are not interested in.

CPU-FPU-TYPES =	68000.soft-float \
		68020.soft-float 68020.68881 \
		68040.soft-float 68040.68881

By default, all of the versions of ixemul.library are built by make.  This
can take a relatively long time.  If you only want to build one particular
version of the library and runtime files to test, just remove the lines
you don't want.  I.E.  to build a 68040+68881 version, the above lines
should be changed to:

CPU-FPU-TYPES =	68040.68881

Then just run "make" in the build directory:

	cd gg-build:ixemul
	make

Note that you must have a version of GNU make that is newer than the ones
distributed on the FreshFish CDs and on aminet.  Those makes had a patch for
AmigaOS that nobody used but disabled an important feature that the current
ixemul Makefiles use.  If you have problem compiling the ixemul library get
the latest Geek Gadgets make from ftp.ninemoons.com:pub/geekgadgets or a
mirror.

You need at least version 2.6.0 of gas, the GNU assembler. Earlier
versions didn't fully support the Motorola assembly syntax, but this one
does. Again, you can get this from Geek Gadgets.

You also need a gcc that accepts the -mrestore-a4 and the -resident32
option (first released in November/December 1996), otherwise ixemul will
not compile.

Finally, if you have an older version of ixemul.library installed while you
are compiling this new version, then you may run into trouble building the
timezone files using the 'zic' utility. This utility requires the latest
ixemul.library (which you have just compiled), but since you haven't
installed it yet, zic complains that the ixemul.library is too old. The
solution is to install the new ixemul.library first, and then continue
compiling. You may have to use 'avail flush' or reboot after installing the
new library to insure that the old library is really flushed from memory.

=======
IXPREFS
=======

Note that effective with ixemul.library 42.0, ixconfig can no longer be
used.  Use ixprefs instead.

==============
REPORTING BUGS
==============

Please report problems or bugs to Hans Verkuil (hans@wyst.hobby.nl), who is
the current ixemul library coordinator.  Even better than a bug report is a
bug fix, which typically would be a context diff file for one or more ixemul
source files.
